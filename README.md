### General Disease Prediction based on symptoms provided by patient- powered by Django & Iot & ML
Data  collection has been done from the internet to identify the disease here the real symptoms of the disease are collected i.e. no dummy values are entered.  
The symptoms of the disease are collected from kaggle.com which is website with a largest of datasets has made using ML & Iot .
This csv file contain 5000 rows of record of the patients with their symptoms(132 types of different symptoms) and their corresponding disease(40 class of general disease)  ,  After the data is collected, it is securely transmitted to the systemâ€™s servers for analysis. With the help of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the data is modified depending  on the  users devices, ensuring seamless integration with the system. The modified data is showed so to the patient with the most disease predcited .
